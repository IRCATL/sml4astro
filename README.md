# Statistical Machine Learning for Astronomy — Notes & Code
This repository is a learning journal based on the book Statistical Machine Learning for Astronomy by Yuan-Sen Ting. It includes :
* Conceptual summaries and notes on key statistical and machine learning ideas presented in the book
* Python code snippets and implementations of selected methods and examples
* Applications to astronomy, focusing on how statistical techniques can be used to extract insights from astronomical data

The goal of this repo is to reinforce understanding through writing, experimentation, and code — combining theory and practice in one place.
